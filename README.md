# Automatic-Bug-Triaging
Automatic bug triaging is a research prototype, a decision support platform for guiding a bug triager for resolver  recommendation using textual and non textual features. This automates the bug triaging. It involves machine learning, data mining,  data science, visualization and information retrieval concepts.

## Introduction
Bug report assignment to a bug fixer or resolver is
an important bug triaging activity. Bug assignment is a manual,
time-consuming and tedious task. Research shows that manual
bug assignment is often error-prone resulting in reassignments
and bug tossing (an issue in both open-source and proprietary
source projects). In this paper, we describe a decision support
platform for guiding a bug triager for resolver recommendation.
We design the decision support framework based on inputs from
practitioners who are part of change control board or bug council
of various product lines within a large engineering company. The
novel aspects of our work in-context to existing work on automatic
bug assignment is the application of non-textual features (in addition to the textual features consisting of terms in the bug reports)
such as the software component, work-load of resolvers, role (such
as triager, tester, product manager, test lead and developer) of a
team-member within the life-cycle of a bug and the collaborationnetwork between the team members. The decision support system
provides justification or reasoning, ranking and confidence score
for every bug-report recommendation. We conduct experiments
to evaluate the performance of our approach and share our
deployment experience, insights and learning
