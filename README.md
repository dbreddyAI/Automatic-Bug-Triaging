# Automatic-Bug-Triaging
Automatic bug triaging is a research prototype, a decision support platform for guiding a bug triager for resolver  recommendation using textual and non textual features. This automates the bug triaging. It involves machine learning, data mining,  data science, visualization and information retrieval concepts.

## Introduction
Bug report assignment to a bug fixer or resolver is an important bug triaging activity. Bug assignment is a manual, time-consuming and tedious task. Research shows that manual bug assignment is often error-prone resulting in reassignments and bug tossing (an issue in both open-source and proprietary source projects). We describe a decision support platform for guiding a bug triager for resolver recommendation. We design the decision support framework based on inputs from practitioners who are part of change control board or bug council of various product lines within a large engineering company.
 	The novel aspects of our work in-context to existing work on automatic bug assignment is the application of non-textual features (in addition to the textual features consisting of terms in the bug reports) such as the software component, work-load of resolvers, role (such as triager, tester, product manager, test lead and developer) of a team-member within the life-cycle of a bug and the collaboration-network between the team members.
The decision support system makes use of machine learning and nlp concepts. Use historical data to train models and predict recommendations.
 	The decision support system provides justification or reasoning, ranking and confidence score for every bug-report recommendation. We conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of our approach and share our deployment experience, insights and learning.
